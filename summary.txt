Summary – Task 4: Firewall Configuration

In this task, a basic firewall rule was configured on a Windows system using Windows Defender Firewall. 
The goal was to understand how firewall rules manage network traffic and protect the system from unauthorized access.

- A new inbound rule was created to block traffic on port 23 (Telnet).
- The rule was tested by attempting to connect to port 23 — the connection was successfully blocked.
- The rule was then removed to restore the system to its original state.

Learning Outcome:
- Gained hands-on experience in navigating firewall settings.
- Understood how to create, test, and remove firewall rules.
- Learned that firewalls are essential for filtering unwanted or malicious traffic.
