## How Firewall Filters Traffic

A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic using pre-defined rules.

In this task:

- We **blocked inbound traffic on port 23**, which is used by the Telnet protocol â€” a known insecure protocol.
- This prevents remote attackers from exploiting the system via Telnet.
- Firewalls act as a **first line of defense** against unauthorized access, malware communication, and data leaks.
- They can be configured to **allow or deny traffic** based on IP, port, protocol, or application.
